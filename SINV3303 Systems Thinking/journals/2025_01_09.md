- #definition Systems Theory
	- Combo of 'general systems theory' (connections form organization/behaviour)
	  Why we get the output we do, regardless of the inputs, outside actors, agents etc.
	- Cybernetics (Feedback regulates behaviour)
	- Complexity (that behaviour is hard to predict, results from lower-order interactions)
- Do I need a systems level approach?
	- You want to make a change, but time and money haven't done it (Stroh 2015)
	- You want to understand a specific question, and find extant evaluation tools insufficient (Cabrera, Colosi & lobdell, 2008)
- when to take a systems approach
	- problem is chronic, defying peoples best intentions/efforts to solve it
	- diverse relevent stakeholders find it difficult to align their efforts despite seemingly shared intentions
	- stakeholders have/continue to try to increase/optimize their part of the system without fully understanding their impact on the whole
	- short term efforts may actually undermine durable solutions
	- people are working on a large number of diverse initiatives at the same time
	- promoting a particular solution comes at the expese of continuous learning
