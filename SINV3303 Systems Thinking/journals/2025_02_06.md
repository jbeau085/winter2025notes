	- (2) Boundaries Precis (what system are you looking at):
		- What are the boundaries you are placing on your analysis?
		- Which systems are you looking at and which might you need to leave behind?
		- Why?
		- **Please cite at least two non-class articles/studies (can include non-peer reviewed). **
	- *Discuss at least two of the flowing: *Temporal Scale; Geographical Scale; Cultural Scale; Legislative/Regulatory; Ecologic
	  **HELPFUL QUESTIONS:** *Why stop there? At what point do connections between parts lose explanatory power? What about this ecosystem/bio-region is helpful? Is this a traditional territory? Is this a jurisdictional boundary - do laws stop applying?  If the boundaries are not clear, are there points of conflict that might actually be helpful to explore?*
