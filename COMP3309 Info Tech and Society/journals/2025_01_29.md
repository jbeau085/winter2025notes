	- Inventors on UNIVAC 1 were surprised because they considered the machine for complex scientific calculation, but it ended up being used often for tabulation
- Inventors of a tech rarely see its ultimate place or role in society.
	- Usually engineers, scientists, exist in a specific context, so they don't think of a use for their tech (computing) outside their context.
- #history Computing in the 1950's
	- because of the lack of a single patent around computing, a wide range of companies develop their own computers.  Chief among them was IBM, who received several lucrative military contracts which allowed IBM to innovate with the cost borne by the state.
	- IBM 701 - IBM first computer, created for the US airforce
	- SAGE computer created for NORAD, first 'networked' computer system.
	- first hard disk 1956, first programming language - FORTRAN 1957, first printer 1959, first transistor based computer IBM 1401 and 7070 1959
	- Transistors made computers more reliable, used to signal binary state on/off
	- IBM 7070 - surprisingly powerful - 150K of RAM, processing similar to late 386 from 1989, 36 bit word size (byte was 9 bits at the time), Intel didn't have a 32-bit chip until 1990's
- #history IBM, NASA and the development of a multitasking operating system.
	- by the early to mid 1960's, computer operating systems were said to be 'batch-driven', that is, you would queue up a 'batch' of problems, and feed them through in batches
	- What NASA wanted was a 'real-time' operating system, or what we today call multi-tasking
	- NASA approached IBM, asking if they had anything like that, IBM said yes, but had no system developed a the time.  NASA funded IBM development of a realtime OS.
	- IBM was able to keep ownership of the OS developed, which helped it dominate computing for the next 20 years.
	- Often, we mistakenly believe the private sector is the sole source of innovation, but in computers and most high tech, the majority of innovation was government funded.
- #history Computing in the 1960's - Computing Boom
	- 1960's experienced the first real massive increase in computer spending.
		- Technical reasons (push)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Transistors made computers cheaper and more reliable.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Software improvements thanks to programming languages like FORTRAN(Science)/COBOL(Business)
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Social reasons (pull)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- the space race required faster and more accurate calculations
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- cold war USSR/USA required newer and newer weapons systems
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- growth in state programs such as social security, pensions, unemployment programs all required massive increase in government record keeping.

- #history Computers and the US Tax System, 1959-1986
	- for many years [Person --Fills--> Tax Form --Mailed to--> Regional Tax Centre --info entered by staff--> IBM Punch cards --fed into--> IBM card reader --info stored--> on big tape machines --onto --> 9 inch tape -- flown/driven --> national tax centre--tape fed-->IBM 7070 --returns printed-->flown/driven back to person]
	- 1974/1975 IRS put forward tech replacement proposal for the system, which would be faster and less expensive.
	- Proposal: Person goes to govt office/post office, uses a terminal that's connected to a regional computer, regional computers connected to national computer that IRS could access.
	- New proposal would make use of technology developed by US defense dept 'internet'
	- 1975, the proposal was voted down by congress[house of representatives in USA]
		- House of rep elected every 2 years, rep by population
		- Why would they voted this down?
		- IRS said system would pay for itself in 3/4 years.
