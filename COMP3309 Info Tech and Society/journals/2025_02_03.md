		- A very 'common sense' way of thinking about this relationship, which one often encoutners.

		  $$\frac{\text{Tech Change}}{\text{Independent variable}} \overrightarrow{\text{Forces}} \frac{\text{Social Change}}{\text{Dependant Variable}}$$
		- #definition  Hard TD - Tech is the only cause for social change, empirically undersupported
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- #definition Soft TD - Tech change opens a door for social change, society can walk through the door, but it isn't forced to. perhaps more evidence supporting this
