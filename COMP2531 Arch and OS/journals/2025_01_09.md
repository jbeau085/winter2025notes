- #definition Von Neumann Architecture
- Common computational bus that the components communicate through
- Idea of how a computer should look, and how componants interact
- 'stored program' arch
- Memory organized into addressable read/write storage locations of a fixed size, eg. 16bit all memory is 16bit, 32 bit, all memory is 32 bit.
- memory contains both data and instructions
- by default, program execution proceeds sequentially
	- #definition Fetch-Execute Cycle
	- Fetches, decodes, executes, saves results one by one

- What is a computer?
	- A Computer is something that uses a __program__ and __internal__ data to transform input into an output
	- Input -> output
	- Uses a program and internal data to transform input->output
	- machine processes data by following precise instructions
	- Computer store and process numbers *and only numbers*
	- Machine that can be programmed to **automatically** carry out  sequences of **logical** and **computational** operations
	-
- #definition Data
	- Collection of facts
	- unorganized
	- does not depend on information
	- isn't sufficient for decision making
- #definition Information
	- puts facts into context
	- organized
	- depends on data
	- sufficient for decision making
- #definition Program
	- Set of precise instructions that can be followed
	- Modern computers - a program contains a one-at-a-time sequence of instructions
- #definition Computer Architecture
	- Conceptual design and functional behaviour of a computer system as seen by the programmer.
	- deals with "what the computer does"

- #definition Computer organization
	- Deals with the physical implementation and operational structure of the computer
	- deals with "how the computer does it"

- #definition Stored Program Arch
	- Hardware is reprogrammable.  Von Neumann.
	- program data can me created, replaced, fixed and edited.
- #definition Fixed program arch
	- Each program is preprogrammed and 'fixed' in place, E.G a regular calculator, plus is always addition, minus is always subtraction
- #definition Harvard Architecture
	- Data goes in one memory, instruction in another, no conflict between data/instruction.
- #definition Instruction Register
- #definition Program Counter
- #definition Pointer
	- Points directly to a memory location.
- What is a CPU?
	- carries out the instructions of a computer program
	- Arithmetic/logic operations
	- read data to memory
	- write data to memory
	- read data from input devices
	- write data to output devices
