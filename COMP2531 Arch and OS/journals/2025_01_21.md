- #binary Add two numbers $x$ and $y$ we add each digit $x_i$ of $x$ to $y-i$ of $y$
	- $x_i + y_i = e_i$
	- if $e_i \geq B$ add 1 to $e-{i+1}$ and set $e-i=x_i+y-i - B$
	- $01110_2 \\ 10110_2$
	- Subtract Y from X, we subtract each digit $y_i$ of Y from $x_i$ of X
	- $x_i - y_i = e_i$
- #logic #definition  Bitwise logical operations
	- Complement (NOT) - Switch 0 to 1 and vice versa
		- Negate, invert, NOT, flipping the bits, toggling all mean the same thing.
		- uses NOT, - ~, or ¬
		- Unary operation, takes a single binary number as an argument.
	- Conjunction (AND) - 1 if and only if *both bits* are 1.
		- AND, &, ^
		- Binary operator, requires two operands
		- in programming && is *logical* while & is *bitwise* operator
			- a = 5, b = 2
			  (a&&b) = TRUE since both are non-zero
			  (a&b) = $0000_2$ $$  \\   101_2 \\ \& 010_2 \\  000_2$$
			-
	- Disjunction (OR) - 1 if and only if *at least one* bit is 1.
		- OR, |, v
		- Binary operator
		- in programming, || is *logical* and | is *bitwise*
			- a=5, b=2
			  (a||b) TRUE because at least one is non-zero
			  (a|b) $0111_2$
				- $$101 \\ 010 \\ 111$$
	- Exclusive Disjunction (XOR) - 1 if and only if *exactly one* of the bits is 1
		- XOR, ⊗
		- binary operator
		-
		-
	- Bit Shifting - *move* the bits *specific positions* to left or right.
